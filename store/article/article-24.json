It is a key factor in endurance sports like running, swimming and cycling, yet it is often overlooked in training programs. Building muscular endurance can help athletes reach their peak performance, as having better muscular endurance can increase stamina and improve overall workout performance. \n\nPart of building muscular endurance is understanding how to do the right exercises to strengthen a muscle group, as well as how to include appropriate rest periods into your routine. High repetitions of moderate-intensity exercises are great for building muscular endurance, as they allow oxygen to reach the muscles more quickly, increasing the strength and stamina needed for exercise. \n\nSome of the best exercises to build muscular endurance are push-ups, pull-ups, air squats, and planks. These exercises provide the right amount of resistance to your muscles, while also focusing on technique and efficiency. In addition to upper body exercises, a combination of plyometrics, circuit training and cardio can be used to increase overall muscular endurance. \n\nMuscular endurance is important for any athlete or fitness enthusiast. By implementing the right combination of exercises and rest periods, you can increase your muscular endurance and take your fitness to the next level. So what are you waiting for?

Plus, it can help you stay in shape and perform better in any activity ‚Äì from running to yoga.\n\nCore strength exercises may include planks, crunches, mountain climbers, and other exercises that engage the abdominals, obliques, and lower back. When done correctly, these exercises can be an effective way to strengthen the core muscles while also toning and sculpting your abs.\n\nBenefits of core strength go beyond aesthetic appeal and physical fitness.

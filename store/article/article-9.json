This amazing exercise practice combines cardio, strength training, functional movement and flexibility to give your body the best of all worlds.\n\nIf your goal is to improve overall fitness and resistance, look no further than regenerative exercise. Working out in one form only (e.g. cardio, weight training) can leave you unbalanced and prone to injury. On the other hand, regenerative exercise helps to build strength and flexibility in the body while promoting balance. It also helps improve posture, core stability and muscular strength. \n\nNot only is regenerative exercise great for physical conditioning, it also offers emotional benefits like stress reduction and a sense of inner peace. It also gives your mind and body a break from the rigours of life, providing such benefits as improved concentration, emotional clarity and mindfulness.\n\nSpecial attention is placed on the breath during regenerative exercise, and practising on a regular basis helps you align your breathing with physical movements. This helps to keep your mind clear and focused, helping you get the most from your workout. \n\nIf youâ€™re looking for a comprehensive form of exercise that will tone your body, increase your strength and flexibility, and also improve your mind and heart, regenerative exercise is the answer. So why wait? Get started today and enjoy all the benefits of this amazing form of exercise.","localFileName":"article-9.png"}
